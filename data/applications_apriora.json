I’d also like to jump in on a smaller, high-impact feature that’s part of the current roadmap-something that can be shipped quickly and deliver immediate value. I’m a firm believer in learning by doing, so tackling a task that touches different parts of the stack would help me get up to speed with the codebase and start contributing right away.</p><p></p><p>2.&nbsp;At Edvo, we built a real-time collaborative canvas tool, and a big part of the challenge was creating an interface that felt seamless for different workflows. I noticed during user testing that people struggled with discovering and finding the right tool at the right time, so I proposed a context-aware action menu that dynamically displayed the most relevant actions/shortcuts based on what the user clicked/selected. This approach reduced the cognitive load and made the experience feel much more ‘magical’ for users. It’s an example where paying attention to user behavior and striving for better user experience really paid off.</p><p></p><p>3.&nbsp;I’m really driven by the opportunity to help people and make difficult or complex processes more accessible and seamless. Recruiting can be overwhelming for everyone, and going through it myself, I definitely feel there are areas for better user empathy. As such, I find it rewarding to create products that make users' workflows or experience smoother and more human-centered. Being able to have real, meaningful impact on users, is what ultimately drives me to continue to work on innovative products.</p>"

I loved to participate in many extracurriculars inside of school, such as organizing BigRed//Hacks, Cornell University's collegiate hackathon, and highly-attended recruiting events for the Association of Computer Science Undergraduates. When I was not in school, I got a kick out of teaching people how to do various things, such as how to code and how to swim. If I'm not dozing off, you can probably find me either swimming or lifeguarding at the pool, volunteering throughout NYC, or jamming to music and browsing the web. I look forward to connecting with you! Programming Languages: C, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, LaTeX",

        "answer": "<p>I have built full-stack applications using React with TypeScript. While at my consulting job, I was tasked with creating a smart widget that would live in Ascension Healthcare’s intranet portal, capable of pulling information about patients and dynamically displaying it on-screen such that employees could filter/sort/search through the patient information. Due to the limits on Ascension’s intranet portal, only 6 packages could be used in the application to be able to be compiled and uploaded to the LumApps intranet portal that they used. With this limitation in mind, I proposed designs to the client and built out the frontend and backend of the widget, which was essentially Google Cloud Functions that would retrieve data from the existing Workspace files that contained the patient data. Although I didn’t create my own backend for this client application, I had to design and propose a secure way for the widget to access the Google Cloud Functions in the GCP backend. Though I didn’t have any experience with cloud security, I learnt the best practices and created a system of two serverless functions, one that would be accessible to only the LumApps widget to create a token given a certain Client ID &amp; Secret and another one that would use this token to access the Workspace files containing the patient data. After multiple meetings with the cloud security team discussing this implementation, it was cleared and approved.</p>"

Since then, they've taken a process that has been dominated by recruiters and phone calls and turned that into a a fully digital experience, connecting nurses directly to job opportunities and facilitating everything that needs to happen in between—including handling benefits, payroll, onboarding, and compliance. Their platform also provides full employer-of-record services for employers in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. \n \nIn 2020, they launched their proprietary staffing platform, Works (www.works.ai). Works helps hospitals meet one of their single biggest challenges: ensuring that every shift gets filled in an environment where both demand for healthcare services and the cost of labor are increasing exponentially. With Works, facilities can create their own on-demand nursing workforce and access one source of truth for all of their clinical workforce needs, from sourcing and onboarding to ongoing compliance. With predictive insights and recommendations, Works helps hospitals easily react to fluctuations in demand, while its staffing marketplace creates competition to fill open job requisitions with high-quality, active talent from a pre-onboarded network of talent suppliers. \n \nThe company has support from top institutional investors such as Craft Ventures, Felicis Ventures, StepStone Group and Founder Collective, as well as healthcare innovators like Texas Medical Center, Mercy Health, Intermountain Ventures, Town Hall Ventures, and Healthbox. In 2020, they were featured on Forbes Next Billion Dollar Startups List.",

We’ve gamified the system and we call the people who take pictures Bounty Hunters and the requests we receive from AI companies are called Bounties. Bounties can be in the form of images, videos, audio files, text files and more. No type of data is too obscure for us. We’ve got Bounty Hunters across the globe and our network of Bounty Hunters is growing rapidly. Our pricing is transparent and is based on the World Bank’s country tiers system. A large majority of the price paid for the data goes to the Bounty Hunters. And before we post a Bounty, the Fuel AI team will review the instruction set to ensure that it’s both comprehensive and simple so that Bounty Hunters can easily understand it and capture the exact, custom data the AI Builder needs. Our mission is to democratize the global AI industry by offering regular, everyday people the opportunity to monetize their first-party AI training data.",

The founding faculty, administrators, and students embraced and embodied this change. They were open and revolutionary in their thinking—more than mere radicals, they dared to imagine a living and learning environment that would foster a community whose passion came from a deep sense of social justice.  \r\n\r\nAnd it shows. \r\n\r\nUC Santa Cruz’s many accomplishments include: \r\n• The first to map the human genome and make it publicly available—for free, forever \r\n• Key contributors to the discovery of the Higgs Boson \r\n• The birthplace of organic farming\r\n• The center of the Dickens Universe\r\n• A graduate gaming program that is one of the top 10 in the country\r\n• Ranked second in the world for its research impact\r\n\r\nThis university is not to be underestimated.\r\n\r\nThe campus's unique character is reflected in its students'​ bold choice to elect the fabled Banana Slug as its mascot—with their determined bearing and bright personality, it's hard to ignore Banana Slugs wherever they may roam.\r\n\r\nAnd Banana Slug alumni are everywhere—a network 100,000-plus-strong, comprised of respected scientists, journalists, social activists, political and business leaders, artists, teachers, entrepreneurs, change-makers, and much more. Banana Slugs are changing the world.",

It's more akin to getting LLMs to use the context of one codebase to produce a complete app satisfying the same features.&nbsp;</p><p>On average, starting codebases had 15,000+ lines of code&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Needs/Challenges&nbsp;</strong></p><p>- Guard rails: a mistake made earlier in the generation propogates to future generations. - Context ordering: RAG and variants of RAG do not account for information ordering – a file needs to be have its dependencies implemented before being implemented itself. - Cost: the token size of enterprise codebases is an order of magnitude greater than the token limit for state of the art models.&nbsp;</p><p>- Nuance: Language servers do not automatically render strict supersets of dependencies, they are also not always available (e.g Angular JS).&nbsp;</p><p>- Automatic Bug Fixing: Catch errors as they spawn, find where they originate, and solve them mid-migration.</p><p>- Quality Assurance: Ensure tests passing in the original codebase are migrated and still passing in the new codebase.&nbsp;</p><p>- Zero-Shot: One codebase topology does not differentiably inform another – customers needed an automatic bespoke solution on command.&nbsp;</p><p>Even with these challenges, Second was able to complete migrations with 95% accuracy – 5% of the lines written by the AI system needed modification to 100% finalize a migration by leveraging the pipeline I owned/created.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Solution&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Foremost, RAG requires that the&nbsp;</p><p>embedding of an incoming query naturally&nbsp;</p><p>embeds closer to an answer to that query.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, in the context of codebases, two files&nbsp;</p><p>which embed more closely are only sparsely&nbsp;</p><p>more likely to depend on each other. From an&nbsp;</p><p>engineering perspective, we needed an&nbsp;</p><p>efficient extensible RAG system, but from a&nbsp;</p><p>Machine Learning perspective we needed to&nbsp;</p><p>solve these shortcomings in a cost effective&nbsp;</p><p>manner. Existing attempts at this solution (e.g GraphRAG, RAGChain, Prompt-RAG, etc) were meant for static document clusters, when our customer documents were dynamic.&nbsp;</p><p>We represented this as a semi-supervised learning problem&nbsp;</p><p>and implemented a Knowledge Graph representation of the&nbsp;</p><p>document store. This knowledge graph representation was&nbsp;</p><p>then queried topologically to render a traversal order for a&nbsp;</p><p>long-context LLM chain of thought approach1. Interestingly,&nbsp;</p><p>when scoring methods for community clusers were applied to&nbsp;</p><p>this approach, it had the effect of organizing the data&nbsp;</p><p>perfectly sequentially.2&nbsp;</p><p>1 Blue edges are learned on-demand, red edges are classic RAG sastisfying an optimal threshold2 E.g, GraphRAG and other such alternatives don't end up with adjacent communities.&nbsp;</p>"

Most retail pricing teams settle for making decisions in spreadsheets, shooting in the dark, and working backward from a cost-plus margin target, leaving a LOT of money on the table.\n\nOur founders experienced these problems at scale when they built pricing tech at Uber that made Uber a billion dollars in profit a year. They realized that retail was lacking the same quality and sophistication of price tooling. So, they built Luca.\n\nLuca is an AI-powered co-pilot for retail operators, which constantly identifies revenue and profit headroom, makes recommendations for price adjustments and saves countless work hours along the way.\n\nLuca is backed by Y Combinator, Menlo Ventures, and others.",

For all the places you want to go. For all the things you want to get. For all the ways you want to earn. Across the entire world. In real time. At the incredible speed of now.\n\nThe idea for Uber was born on a snowy night in Paris in 2008, and ever since then our DNA of reimagination and reinvention carries on. We’ve grown into a global platform powering flexible earnings and the movement of people and things in ever expanding ways. We’ve gone from connecting rides on 4 wheels to 2 wheels to 18-wheel freight deliveries. From takeout meals to daily essentials to prescription drugs to just about anything you need at any time and earning your way. From drivers with background checks to real-time verification, safety is a top priority every single day. At Uber, the pursuit of reimagination is never finished, never stops, and is always just beginning.",

      "about": "Hello! Hamir here. I'm a software engineer and U.S. citizen living in the San Francisco Bay Area. I've written open-source software for over 5 years. You can see my public contributions at https://github.com/hamirmahal. I added 2 features to VSCode, Microsoft’s text editor with over 2.6 million monthly active users in 2017 (https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/11/16/connect), using Node.js, TypeScript, and JavaScript (https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ahamirmahal). I also added an auto-fix to Clippy, Rust’s official linter, which has over 11,000 stars on GitHub, using Rust, Git, and Linux (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/12836/files). I had 3 changes merged into Next.js, Vercel's React web application framework used by Twitch, TikTok, Netflix, Nike, OpenAI, Spotify, LG, and The Washington Post (https://nextjs.org/showcase). I intertwined my passions for computer science and accessibility when I added captioning for several MIT computer science lectures while watching them.

I joined Antler, a global early-stage VC, as the head of product in February 2022, with the vision to fundamentally improve the world by enabling and investing in exceptional entrepreneurs. At Antler, I conducted 100+ customer interviews and created a product roadmap for a Defi application that unlocks 7B USD by enabling stock-backed lending. I also spearheaded a team of five and prototyped a smart job search application that resulted in internal acquisition and new user growth by 2000+ (20% YOY). In addition, I analyzed SAP's financial statements and submitted a proposal to reduce customer acquisition cost by 5%. I leveraged my skills in MVP, web development, and corporate leadership to deliver these projects successfully. I left Antler in June 2022, after completing a rewarding and challenging stint.",
