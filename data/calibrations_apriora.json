Taken together, our platform unlocks the ability to search biology, where complex questions about human disease can be asked and answered for the first time. \n\nWe build and provide these capabilities to our network of leading academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies around the world. Our collaborative research spans numerous indications, with a core focus on unmet needs in oncology and autoimmune diseases. We advance science by accelerating data generation, methods development, research insights, and high-impact publications. Our interdisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, researchers, and investors focuses on decoding biological systems to make drug discovery, development, and patient care more deterministic. Come join us on our mission to decipher biology and meaningfully improve the way patients are treated.",

I added 2 features to VSCode, Microsoft’s text editor with over 2.6 million monthly active users in 2017 (https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/11/16/connect), using Node.js, TypeScript, and JavaScript (https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ahamirmahal). I also added an auto-fix to Clippy, Rust’s official linter, which has over 11,000 stars on GitHub, using Rust, Git, and Linux (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/12836/files). I had 3 changes merged into Next.js, Vercel's React web application framework used by Twitch, TikTok, Netflix, Nike, OpenAI, Spotify, LG, and The Washington Post (https://nextjs.org/showcase). I intertwined my passions for computer science and accessibility when I added captioning for several MIT computer science lectures while watching them.

The founding faculty, administrators, and students embraced and embodied this change. They were open and revolutionary in their thinking—more than mere radicals, they dared to imagine a living and learning environment that would foster a community whose passion came from a deep sense of social justice.  \r\n\r\nAnd it shows. \r\n\r\nUC Santa Cruz’s many accomplishments include: \r\n• The first to map the human genome and make it publicly available—for free, forever \r\n• Key contributors to the discovery of the Higgs Boson \r\n• The birthplace of organic farming\r\n• The center of the Dickens Universe\r\n• A graduate gaming program that is one of the top 10 in the country\r\n• Ranked second in the world for its research impact\r\n\r\nThis university is not to be underestimated.\r\n\r\nThe campus's unique character is reflected in its students'​ bold choice to elect the fabled Banana Slug as its mascot—with their determined bearing and bright personality, it's hard to ignore Banana Slugs wherever they may roam.\r\n\r\nAnd Banana Slug alumni are everywhere—a network 100,000-plus-strong, comprised of respected scientists, journalists, social activists, political and business leaders, artists, teachers, entrepreneurs, change-makers, and much more. Banana Slugs are changing the world.",

My expertise lies at the intersection of AI/ML, Data Science, and Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a focus on leveraging generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Journey & Reggelia: Growing up, my confidence in speaking Hindi was shattered when I visited relatives in India. This gap between theoretical knowledge and practical fluency led me to co-found Reggelia, a speech-focused language learning platform. Reggelia's mission is to enable users to immerse themselves in the culture of the language they are learning, gaining practical conversation practice and the confidence to speak fluently. Role & Innovation: As a co-founder, I led full stack development, utilizing TypeScript, CSS, Node.js, and various backend frameworks. Reggelia integrates advanced AI models to enhance speech recognition and language processing, focusing on practical conversation practice and cultural immersion. Join Us: Let's make language learning more effective and accessible. Educators, teachers, and tutors, reach out at atomar@reggelia.com to discuss how Reggelia can benefit students.",

The founding faculty, administrators, and students embraced and embodied this change. They were open and revolutionary in their thinking—more than mere radicals, they dared to imagine a living and learning environment that would foster a community whose passion came from a deep sense of social justice.  \r\n\r\nAnd it shows. \r\n\r\nUC Santa Cruz’s many accomplishments include: \r\n• The first to map the human genome and make it publicly available—for free, forever \r\n• Key contributors to the discovery of the Higgs Boson \r\n• The birthplace of organic farming\r\n• The center of the Dickens Universe\r\n• A graduate gaming program that is one of the top 10 in the country\r\n• Ranked second in the world for its research impact\r\n\r\nThis university is not to be underestimated.\r\n\r\nThe campus's unique character is reflected in its students'​ bold choice to elect the fabled Banana Slug as its mascot—with their determined bearing and bright personality, it's hard to ignore Banana Slugs wherever they may roam.\r\n\r\nAnd Banana Slug alumni are everywhere—a network 100,000-plus-strong, comprised of respected scientists, journalists, social activists, political and business leaders, artists, teachers, entrepreneurs, change-makers, and much more. Banana Slugs are changing the world.",
