As a Founding Software Engineer at Serval, you'll play a pivotal role in shaping the future of our platform. You will be tasked with building foundational parts of our technology and your contributions will be key to defining the success of our product

At Serval, we're building the AI platform for IT teams. Our goal is to take on legacy players like ServiceNow, a $230+ bn company, by building the platform for AI agents to resolve IT issues instead of humans.

Serval automates the automation, using a natural language-to-code workflow builder and AI agents that discover and deliver automations for tedious IT workflows.

Our mission is to free IT departments from the #helpdesk channel by creating the simplest way to automate employee onboarding/offboarding, software access management, and the long tail of employee requests. Long term, our vision extends to developing a universal workflow automation platform for all business functions.

Serval was founded by product and engineering leaders from Verkada and is backed by industry-leading investors like First Round, General Catalyst, Alt Capital, and Box Group.

Recruiting advice:
1. Elite, at this stage we're only interested in candidates that would have been in top 5% of Verkada, who has a very high bar. Generally that means some combination 2+ signals of excellence

4. Early-stage startup (Series A or earlier with tier 1 investors) or founder (CTO) experience
5. High slope, signs of extraordinary career progression (promotion or bigger scope, or bigger roles/better companies)

avoid traits:
-Non-quantitative undergrad (i.e. coding bootcamp)
-signs of career stagnation / slow growth (no promotion, non-competitive companies)
-short stints - more than 3 <18 months, only big company experience
-lack of interest in super early stage startup - it'tough and have to want it

-Early-stage startup (Series A or earlier with tier 1 investors) or founder (CTO experience)
